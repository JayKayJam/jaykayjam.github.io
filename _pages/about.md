**I'm a Computer Engineer** who has a particular focus in robotics and embedded systems. I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from George Mason University in 2025 and am currently enrolled in their Master's program for Computer Engineering with a concentration in Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems. 
<br>I am actively seeking new opportunities to learn and work in multiple fields related to my interests including software development, CAD design and robotics-oriented positions.

From my projects I've found myself enjoying the entire process of project development including brainstorming, hardware selection/creation and software development. Learning new skills is a large motivator for me, and I hope that education and work will help my continued pursuance of broadening my knowledge and skillset.

If you want to get an understanding of what type of projects I enjoyed working on, I recommend vising my [Portfolio]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/) section. I will continue to add additional projects in this section as I finish them.
